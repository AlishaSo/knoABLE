# knoABLE

Do you love reading books, but have a hard time finding new ones to read? Are you intrigued by books that have ranked in a New York Times bestseller's list? Well knoABLE is the app for you! ✨knoABLE✨ gets its name from the words ___knowledge___ and ___expandable___ being combined. It let's a user find out whether a book they read has been a NYT bestseller; or to get a book that has been, or is currently, a NYT bestseller.
